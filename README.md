# next-strapi-template

## What's here

Each sub-project contains README which should get you up and running. More documentation can be found [here](https://bratislava.github.io)

🏡 `/next` Next.js web app

🗄️ `/strapi` Strapi CMS server

🐳 `docker-compose.yml` - if you need to quickly setup postgres or meilisearch instance, run `docker compose up postgres`. You need docker installed

💅 `.prettierrc` - presently needed for prettier to work well when opening root directory in vscode (PRs to get rid of it & config it better are welcome)
